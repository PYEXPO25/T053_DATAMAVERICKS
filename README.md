## Smart Energy Meter for Household Consumption

*Problem Statement ID â€“ PY088*

Traditional energy meters provide little insight beyond total consumption, making it hard for users to optimize their electricity usage.
They face challenges like ,
lack of real-time monitoring and breakdown of appliance-level consumption,
high electricity bills due to inefficient usage and
environmental impact from excessive energy consumption.

---

## Overview

The Smart Energy Meter is designed to monitor household electricity consumption in real-time, helping users optimize usage, cut costs, and reduce environmental impact.

Objective:
provide real-time energy tracking,
offer appliance-level insights to identify high-consumption devices and
send alerts & energy-saving suggestions to reduce wastage.

Proposed Solution:
Sensors (SCT-013, ZMPT101B) measure current & voltage,
ESP32 (Wi-Fi) transmits data to the cloud,
Mobile App/Web Dashboard displays real-time usage & alerts and
AI-driven insights help optimize energy consumption.

Outcome: Lower electricity bills, reduced energy waste, and a smarter, eco-friendly home.
